# Arabic-Dictionary
This project is a web-based Arabic dictionary application that allows users to search for words in the Arabic language and view their definitions. The application uses a custom-built dictionary database and a user-friendly interface to provide a seamless user experience.

The Arabic Dictionary Web project aims to provide a comprehensive and reliable resource for Arabic language learners and speakers. The dictionary database is continuously updated to ensure accuracy and relevancy, and users can easily contribute new words or suggest corrections.

We hope that this project will be a valuable resource for Arabic language learners and speakers, and we welcome feedback and suggestions for how we can improve it.
